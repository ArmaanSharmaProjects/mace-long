--- Long Range Force Test (Separation: 8.00 A) ---

[ ORIGINAL MACE ]
Force on O (Z): 0.00000000 eV/A
Charges:        N/A (Standard MACE does not predict charges)
DEBUG: Number of graphs: 1
DEBUG: Atoms per graph: [tensor(2, device='cuda:0')]

[ MODIFIED 4G MACE ]
Force on O (Z): 0.00390625 eV/A
Predicted Q:    [0.5 0.5]

--- Physical Comparison ---
RESULT: SUCCESS. The original model is blind at this range.
The modified model correctly captures long-range electrostatics.
